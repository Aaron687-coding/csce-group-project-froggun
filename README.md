Hello everybody reading this!
Welcome to froggun, a game where you are a frog with a shotgun!
There is no tutorial in-game, so here it is:

lmb: shoot with da gun
rmb: grapple with your tongue
wasd: doesn't do anything unless you hop with spacebar
r: reload the gun!

that's it!
The rest of it is described in-game.
Beware of wasps and turtles!

Sincerely
Aaron, Fisher, & Austin
